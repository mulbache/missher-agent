"""A pooled Desktop backend (``missher --profile X serve``, MISSHER_HOME=<root>/profiles/X) answers its
REST without ``?profile=``. Those UNSCOPED reads/verbs are about X — a profile the live default
multiplexer serves — and must agree with the scoped ``?profile=X`` answer and with ``missher -p X status``:
running-via-multiplexer, start/stop refused, restart addressed to the multiplexer's home.

Live repro (Desktop over a multiplexed HOME): Command Center said "Messaging gateway stopped" for X,
the Messaging page pinned every platform "gateway stopped", and Restart spawned a bare ``gateway
restart`` under X's MISSHER_HOME that exited 78 while the UI reported success.
